== IgniterPlate ==
IgniterPlate combines CodeIgniter, HTML5 Boilerplate, and Zurb Foundation CSS Framework.

== Apache / mod_rewrite ==
IgniterPlate assumes you are using Apache 2 Web Server with mod_rewrite enabled.
This allows those running Apache with mod_rewrite to get started quickly without configuration.

== Changes to CodeIgniter ==

- application/config/autoload.php
url helper autoloaded to provide absolute paths to scripts and styles. Make sure to define your $config['base_url'] in application/config/config.php.

- application/config/routes.php
$route['404_override'] = 'error/page_not_found' to load the HTML5 Boilerplate 404 page.

- application/config/config.php
Removed 'index.php' from $config['index_page'] because urls are rewritten without index.php via .htaccess.

- application/controllers
error.php added to control 404 errors.

- application/views
html5/head and html5/scripts added to place before and after the main content of a view to load the HTML5 Boilerplate, scripts, and styles â€” inculding those needed for Foundation CSS Framework.
zurb_foundation.php and igniterplate.php included to provide relevant welcome documentation.
welcome_message.php modified to include above views, along with CodeIgniter's welcome_message, renamed to ci_welcome_message.php

- .htaccess
Using HTML5 Boilerplate default .htaccess, plus rewrite rules to strip index.php from CodeIgniter urls.

- build, css, img, js, & test directories
Directories added within the root directory to contain tools, scripts, stylesheets, and images added by HTML5 Boilerplate, Foundation CSS Framework, as well as your own.
Once Build script is run, intermediate and publish directories may also be added.

- apple touch icons, favicon, crossdomain.xml, humans.txt, robots.txt
Inserted in the root directory for HTML5 Boilerplate (icons modified to display IgniterPlate branding). Read the docs on HTML5 Boilerplate for more information.

  
    
== Build Tool ==

Installation and Use
- Read the HTML5 Boilerplate docs on how to install Apache Ant and use the build tool.
- You can also try digging into /build/config/project.properties to add or change the behavior of the build script.

Pointers
- Use @import at the bottom style.css to import other css files (so the build tool will concatenate them all). The ant build tool doesn't seem to like concatenating and minifying the html/head css files.
- But also include them in the html5/head view so they load into view before the build. (Don't worry. The ant build tool will remove these.)
