IgniterPlate

IgniterPlate combines CodeIgniter and HTML5 Boilerplate.

Changes to CodeIgniter:

If you're already familiar with CodeIgniter, there are few configuration changes already in place.
.htaccess and /application/config/config.php have been modified to allow clean urls (without the index.php).
The default controller has been changed from 'welcome' to 'home',
and the url helper is autoloaded in application/config/autoload.php

Views:

/application/views/template.php - This is the view you'll want to call from your controller.
You can load your own views by following the example in the home/index controller.

    $data = array(
        'title'         => 'My Title',
        'main_content'  => 'path_to/view_file',
        'other'         => 'other custom data'
    );
    $this->load->view('template', $data);
    
    
Build Tool:

Note:
Do not change the name of /application/views/template.php unless you also change the project properties in /build/config/project.properties.
    The build tool knows to look for the template.php file to change links to minified javascript and css files.

To use the build tool, you'll need Java, Ant, optipng, and jpegtran installed. More information on the build tool can be found at the HTML5 Boilerplate website: http://html5boilerplate.com

Navigate to the /build folder from the command line and type 'ant build'. This will output your optimized site to the /publish/ folder.
Provied all the necessary software is installed, this will minify your css and javascript, compress pngs and jpgs, and make the appropriate changes to the template.php file.
